# LetsGoBiking

## Description
This project was developed as part of the Middleware and Service-Oriented Computing course and focuses on building a self-hosted SOAP server in C# with advanced features such as caching, message queuing, and proxy handling. The server is complemented by a web client designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive interface for itinerary planning.

The SOAP server integrates data from the JC Decaux API and an external REST API to process and deliver routing services. The web client enables users to submit requests and visualize optimized itineraries through an intuitive and responsive design.

The project illustrates the practical application of middleware concepts, showcasing the interoperability of SOAP and RESTful services. It highlights the importance of service-oriented architecture (SOA) in integrating diverse technologies into a cohesive system, focusing on real-time data processing, effective client-server interaction, and seamless API integration.

## üåü Key Features

### Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.8
- Java 11+
- ActiveMQ
- Maven

### üöÄ Installation and step-by-step setup
>‚ö†Ô∏è[WARNING]  
> Due to Windows 10/11 port access policies and protected system resources, you must run the servers as an administrator to allow them to host services on localhost. If you are running the servers from an IDE, ensure that you launch your IDE as an administrator as well.
  
> üí° [NOTE]  
> Ensure that your environment variables are properly configured for tools like ([msbuild (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?cid=learn-onpage-download-cta#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022), [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/downloads), [activemq](https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/download/) and [mvn](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)), If everything is set up, you can run the process automatically with `launch_project.bat`.

1. üõ†Ô∏è **Clone** the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WalidELAJI/Web-Front-Development/
```

2. üåê **Start ActiveMQ:**
**Open** an ActiveMQ instance in a terminal. Ensure it is [you have it installed](https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/download/)and added to your system's environment variables.

```bash
activemq start
```

3. ‚öôÔ∏è  **Set Up the RoutingServer:**
**Navigate** to the `RoutingServer` directory and **build** the solution. The RoutingServer integrates key components:
  - **SOAP server** for handling requests.
  - **Caching mechanism** to improve performance.
  - **Proxy functionality** for routing services.

```bash
cd RoutingServer
nuget restore RoutingServer.sln
msbuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:TargetFrameworkVersion=v4.8
start "Routing Server" .RoutingServer\RoutingServer\bin\Debug\RoutingServer.exe
```

4. üíª **Launch the Web Client:**
**Navigate** to the `src` directory and open the `index.html` file in your default web browser. This file serves as the front-end for displaying the routing services.

```bash
cd ../src
start index.html
```
